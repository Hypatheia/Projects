## Project Overview

Welcome to my second project on the road to freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This time, the goal was to create a tribute page that pays homage to an iconic figure. Initially, I tried to recreate the sample page identically to meet the certification requirements. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I decided to add a bit of magic from the Barbie universe and make it Barbie-themed to match my creative journey.

**Barbie**, the world's iconic fashion doll, has transcended generations, inspiring people to dream big, shatter stereotypes and embrace their true selves. Beyond her fashionable exterior, Barbie symbolises empowerment, resilience and limitless potential. She challenges traditional gender roles and encourages us to reach for the stars.

## Learning and Progress

My learning journey for this project has been marked by a focus on improving responsiveness. Whilst I was initially successful in creating a responsive design, I realised that the aesthetics could be improved, particularly as the window size increased. To address this, I reviewed my code and made key improvements.

I added a max-width feature to ensure that the site retained its visual appeal on larger screens. I also adjusted the width of various text elements, such as lists, subtitles and headers, to create a more harmonious layout. To add a touch of Barbie magic, I sourced a Barbie-like font for the headlines and redesigned the unordered list (ul).

Like Barbie herself, my journey is one of empowerment, creativity, and growth. Thank you for joining me on this adventure.
