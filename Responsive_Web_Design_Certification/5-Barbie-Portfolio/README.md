# Barbie Portfolio

Welcome to my final Barbie Portfolio project! This portfolio showcases a Barbie-themed web page with a creative and playful design. It is the culmination of my journey to earn freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its features, and my learning experiences during its development.

## Project Overview

The Barbie Portfolio is a visually appealing web page designed to showcase a collection of Barbie-themed projects. This landing page is the fifth project in my journey to achieve freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. It originally started as an identical recreation of a sample page, but I decided to infuse it with the Barbie theme, following the creative approach of my previous three projects.

### Features

- **Navigation**: A fixed navigation bar with links to different sections of the page, including "About," "Work," "Contact," and a dropdown menu for previous Barbie-themed projects.

- **Introduction**: The "About" section provides a warm welcome and introduces me as "Hypatheia," a web developer, and an art conservator Barbie.

- **Barbie Showcase**: In the "Work" section, you'll find a collection of Barbie projects with playful descriptions. Click on each project to learn more.

- **Contact**: The "Contact" section invites users to connect with me through various social media links.

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to be responsive, ensuring a great user experience on different devices.

### Learning and Progress

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to learn and experiment with various aspects of web development:

- **Icon Implementation**: I integrated icons from Font Awesome for the first time and customized their appearance to match the Barbie theme.

- **CSS Styling**: I encountered challenges with CSS styling, including issues with footer width, which I successfully resolved.

- **Image Manipulation**: I added Barbie product images and adjusted the logo's appearance using CSS properties like `filter: brightness();`.

The Barbie Portfolio is not just a demonstration of my web development skills but also a reflection of my creative journey. I enjoyed working on this project, and I hope you enjoy exploring the Barbie-themed world I've created!
