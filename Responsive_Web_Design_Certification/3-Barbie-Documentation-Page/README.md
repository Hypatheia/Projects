## Project Overview

Welcome to my documentation page, which is the third step in my journey towards freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This project required me to create a page that provides documentation on a specific topic. Unlike my first certification project, where I aimed to replicate the sample documentation page as closely as possible, I decided to infuse my code with the enchanting **Barbie** theme.

## Learning and progress

As I delved into this project, I found myself becoming more confident in my coding skills. My initial code was fine, but I wanted to add a touch of uniqueness to match the Barbie theme. I explored the use of `:hover' and `:active' functions to create interactive and engaging elements. I also got experience changing the appearance of `<code></code>` elements, adjusting their opacity to enhance their visibility. Additionally, I transformed the appearance of `<ol></ol>` elements by applying the Barbie-like font and a custom font color. These additions not only made the site more engaging, but also contributed to a more immersive Barbie experience.

When rewriting my code, I placed a strong emphasis on cleanliness and organisation. I wanted the code to reflect the precision and elegance associated with Barbie. This focus on clean code not only improves readability, but also ensures that the site runs smoothly.

I also had the pleasure of using ChatGPT to generate content, filling the documentation with relevant and engaging information. Working with AI added an exciting dimension to the project and allowed me to create a more informative and user-friendly site.

Just as **Barbie** continues to evolve and inspire, my journey in web development evolves with each project. Thank you for joining me on this creative and empowering adventure.
