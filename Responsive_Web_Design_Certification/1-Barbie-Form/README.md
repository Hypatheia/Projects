## Project Overview

This project represents the first milestone on my journey towards freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. The initial goal was to create a functional web application with a design similar to the example found at [https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks). However, my commitment to growth and learning led me to take this opportunity  to hone my skills in a practical way.

Initially, I set out to create a faithful replica of the supplied example and successfully passed the certification requirements. However, during this process, I noticed some aesthetic aspects that weren't quite optimal and deviated from the original. Rather than simply correcting these issues, I decided to turn this project into a creative endeavour inspired by the Barbie universe.

Inspired by the world of Barbie and her captivating adventures, I decided to put a unique spin on the traditional survey form. The result is an innovative survey that delves into Barbie archetypes and offers users an engaging opportunity to explore their personal connection with Barbie and express their individual preferences. This imaginative survey poses thought-provoking questions such as 'Which Barbie archetype best describes you?', 'Would you recommend being a Barbie to a friend?' and 'What kind of Barbie do you aspire to be?

By infusing my project with the charm and whimsy of the Barbie film, I found a delightful and fun theme that allowed me to express my creativity while honing my web development skills. This transformation from a faithful replica to a unique and imaginative project embodies my dedication to embracing challenges and making each project my own.


## Learning and progress

Throughout the project I encountered various challenges and opportunities for growth. An important aspect of my learning journey was identifying and solving problems within my code. For example, I encountered difficulties with both the background image and the background gradient. To overcome these challenges, I delved into my coding skills and through experimentation was able to optimise the design. Transforming the code allowed me to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing and responsive layout. I learned that with dedication and a problem-solving mindset, I could turn obstacles into stepping stones.

I also brought my new-found knowledge to the project with the aim of creating cleaner and more accessible code. This reflects my commitment not only to completing the project, but also to continually improving my web development skills.


## Use and presentation

To share my progress and achievements, my learning partner <a href="https://github.com/ktothe" target="_blank" alt="A link to ktothe's freeCodeCamp profile">@ktothe</a> showed me how to host my project on Vercel directly from GitHub. This streamlined approach provides easy access to demo pages for all of my certification projects, facilitating interaction and feedback.
